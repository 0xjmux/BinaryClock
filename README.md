# BinaryClock
![Binary Clock Image](/images/binaryClockRight.PNG)

Code for my Binary Clock, which I built while bored in Computer Science class. It displays the time in binary format, instead of standard decimal. 

The parts you will need are: 
 - Arduino/Genuino Mega
 - DS1307 RTC module
 - 20 LEDs
 - 20 220 ohm Resistors
 - Jumper cables & a breadboard.


This code uses an DS1307 RTC module, which requires Jeelab's RTClib library. This can be found at https://github.com/adafruit/RTClib
